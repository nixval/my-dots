# Hyprland-specific environment variables.
# These are loaded by UWSM ONLY before starting Hyprland.
# This is the correct place for HYPR* and AQ_* variables.

# --- Hyprland Debugging ---
# [ACTION] Uncomment these only if you are debugging Hyprland itself.
# export HYPRLAND_TRACE=1
# export HYPRLAND_NO_RT=1

# --- Aquamarine (Renderer) ---
# [ACTION] Uncomment if you have multiple GPUs (e.g., laptop with Intel+NVIDIA)
# and need to force Hyprland to use a specific one.
# Use 'ls /dev/dri/by-path' to find your card paths.
#
# Example (forcing Intel iGPU):
# export AQ_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/by-path/pci-0000:00:02.0-card
#
# Example (NVIDIA dGPU primary, Intel fallback):
# export AQ_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/by-path/pci-0000:01:00.0-card:/dev/dri/by-path/pci-0000:00:02.0-card

# [ACTION] Uncomment this if you have an Intel iGPU and an external monitor
# connected via a dock, and the monitor is blank.
# export AQ_NO_MODIFIERS=1
